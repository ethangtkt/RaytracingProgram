# Raytracing Program
- - - -
## About The Foundation Of Computer Graphics ##
This program was made in my junior year of college. This class brought heavy focus into vectors and vector arithmetic. Mastering the skills of normalizing, morphing, and creating vectors was a dependency to do all of the fun stuff later down the road. We first learned about raytracing, this process takes every pixel and computes a color based on the “shapes” within the scene.  When comparing this algorithm to an “object-ordered” algorithm, it is much slower in computation time but it gave me a great understanding of how 3D scenes are rendered on computers. Late in the class, we learned about “object-ordered rendering” which is an algorithm that computes the color of shapes by object rather than by pixel. 

## About The Program ##
This program revolves around the concept of raytracing. Raytracing is a term for a *fancy* algorithm that renders 3D images in computer graphics. The algorithm takes a viewing ray for every pixel within the window and “shoots” them into the scene and calculates a color for the corresponding pixel. If a window has a size of 200px by 100px, there will be a total of 20,000 pixels, thus 20,000 viewing rays. After all of the viewing, rays have been calculated for the window, the frame will be shown. This process will repeat continuously.
